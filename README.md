Hey econ, I can help you for U.S. Treasury Fiscal Data.

## Data Source

The financial data used in this analysis is sourced from the U.S. Treasury's Fiscal Data API. This API provides access to a wide range of fiscal and financial data related to the U.S. government's operations.

- **API Endpoint**: [U.S. Treasury Fiscal Data API](https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/datasets/)

The U.S. Treasury Fiscal Data API is a valuable resource for exploring and understanding the government's financial activities, and it serves as the foundation for the insights and visualizations presented in this repository.


# U.S. Treasury Fiscal Data API Python Analysis

Welcome to the U.S. Treasury Fiscal Data API Python Analysis repository! This project showcases a Python-based analysis of financial data obtained from the U.S. Treasury's Fiscal Data API. We delve into the data to gain insights and visualize key financial metrics.

## Introduction

The U.S. Treasury Fiscal Data API provides a wealth of information about the financial operations of the U.S. government. This repository houses Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks that access this data, perform data manipulation, and generate visualizations to help us understand the fiscal health of the government.

## Project Highlights

- **Data Retrieval:** We use Python's `requests` library to fetch financial data from the U.S. Treasury's API.

- **Data Analysis:** Our Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks perform data cleaning, transformation, and calculation of key financial metrics.

- **Data Visualization:** We use popular data visualization libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to create insightful charts and graphs.

## Dataset I: U.S. Treasury Operating Cash Balance

The heart of our analysis relies on the U.S. Treasury's "Operating Cash Balance" dataset. This dataset, obtained from the [U.S. Treasury Fiscal Data API](https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/datasets/daily-treasury-statement/operating-cash-balance), provides a detailed view of the U.S. government's daily financial operations, offering insights into the inflow and outflow of cash into the Treasury's accounts.

### Key Information

- **API Endpoint**: [U.S. Treasury Operating Cash Balance Dataset](https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/datasets/daily-treasury-statement/operating-cash-balance)
- **Data Coverage**: The dataset encompasses a comprehensive set of financial data, including opening and closing cash balances, daily deposits, and withdrawals.
- **Code**: [Python Analysis](https://github.com/veridelisi/U.S.-Treasury-Fiscal-Data/blob/main/Operating_Cash_Balance.ipynb)

Our analysis leverages this valuable dataset to understand and visualize the dynamics of the U.S. government's cash flow, examine monthly trends, and gain insights into the financial health of the nation.

Please note that this dataset is updated regularly, and our analysis reflects the latest available data to provide you with a current snapshot of the U.S. Treasury's financial status.


## Dataset II: U.S. Treasury Deposits and Withdrawals of Operating Cash 

Our comprehensive analysis is not complete without the inclusion of the "U.S. Treasury Deposits and Withdrawals of Operating Cash" dataset. This dataset, also sourced from the U.S. Treasury Fiscal Data API, provides crucial information about the daily deposits and withdrawals into the U.S. Treasury's accounts. By adding this dataset to our analysis, we gain deeper insights into the U.S. government's cash flow dynamics.

### Key Information

- **API Endpoint**: [U.S. Treasury Deposits and Withdrawals of Operating Cash ](https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/datasets/daily-treasury-statement/deposits_withdrawals_operating_cash)
- **Data Coverage**: This dataset offers a comprehensive record of daily financial transactions, allowing us to track the movement of cash into and out of the U.S. Treasury.
- **Code**: [Python Analysis]([https://github.com/veridelisi/U.S.-Treasury-Fiscal-Data/blob/main/Operating_Cash_Balance.ipynb](https://github.com/veridelisi/U.S.-Treasury-Fiscal-Data/blob/main/Deposits%20and%20Withdrawals%20of%20Operating%20Cash.ipynb)https://github.com/veridelisi/U.S.-Treasury-Fiscal-Data/blob/main/Deposits%20and%20Withdrawals%20of%20Operating%20Cash.ipynb)

Our Python analysis continues with the integration of the "U.S. Treasury Deposits and Withdrawals of Operating Cash" dataset. 

ðŸ¥‡How much the US Treasury collects in taxes per day, 
ðŸ¥ˆHow much the US Treasury spends per day and 
ðŸ¥‰How much the US Treasury borrows per day

This addition enables us to:

-Examine the daily inflow and outflow of cash into U.S. Treasury accounts.
-Identify patterns and trends in deposit and withdrawal activities.
-Create visualizations to provide a clear and comprehensive representation of the cash flow dynamics.
-Gain a more profound understanding of the U.S. Treasury's financial position and how it evolves over time.
-The combination of both datasets allows us to paint a holistic picture of the U.S. government's financial health and provides valuable insights into its financial operations.
-Top 10 largest values within the taxes
-Top 10 largest values within the expenditures
-New debt issuance and debt redemptions


Please note that the API data for both datasets is updated regularly, ensuring that our analysis offers real-time insights into the U.S. Treasury's financial activities.

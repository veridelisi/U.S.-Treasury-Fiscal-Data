# U.S. Treasury Fiscal Data API Python Analysis

Welcome to the U.S. Treasury Fiscal Data API Python Analysis repository! This project showcases a Python-based analysis of financial data obtained from the U.S. Treasury's Fiscal Data API. We delve into the data to gain insights and visualize key financial metrics.

## Introduction

The U.S. Treasury Fiscal Data API provides a wealth of information about the financial operations of the U.S. government. This repository houses Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks that access this data, perform data manipulation, and generate visualizations to help us understand the fiscal health of the government.

## Project Highlights

- **Data Retrieval:** We use Python's `requests` library to fetch financial data from the U.S. Treasury's API.

- **Data Analysis:** Our Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks perform data cleaning, transformation, and calculation of key financial metrics.

- **Data Visualization:** We use popular data visualization libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to create insightful charts and graphs.
